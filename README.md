# JDOC Manual

This version is obsolete and was archive on 2024-0326.

This component can display pages from a Mediawiki server with 
the aid of an index document. For example, you may wish to switch 
from Joomla 4 documents to Joomla 3 documents and to see 
documents for a custom component delivered by a custom 
Mediawiki server. The sources and languages to use are stored
in component database tables. The default installation has indexes 
for Joomla 4 and Joomla 4 Help Screens. The indexes need to be 
updated regularly.

New in version 0.5: a Site page. Please uninstall any previous 
version before installing this new version.

After installation you first need to fetch the index
document by selecting the <strong>Fetch Index</strong> button
in the toolbar. Each time you do this the index is fetched
and stored as html in a new entry in the database. This is 
what appears in the component index panel at the left of the 
content area.

With the index panel populated you can select an item from
the list. On first selection the page is fetched from the
document server, processed to make it suitable for display
in the JDOC Manual component, and saved in the database.
On a later request for that page it is fetched from the
database.

If you have reason to believe that the page may be out of 
date you can select the <strong>Update Page</strong> button 
to re-fetch the page from source.

If you want to see the page in a different language you need 
to set up the language list and then select the language from
the <strong>Language</strong> button in the toolbar. If the
document is not available in the selected language you will
see the English version with a message to that effect at 
the top. You can select the Index language and Document languages 
separately but it will be a while before many indexes are 
translated.

The version of the page displayed in the Manual differs
from the original as follows:

* Everything above the main content is removed.
* The footer and everything below is removed.
* All links are removed because they do not work as expected
in this context.

If you find a problem with the content of a page you could join
the documentation team and fix it yourself!
